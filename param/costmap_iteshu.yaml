#track_unknown_space [true] by default: when this is set to "true", the robot will have a much more conservative behaviour and will try to avoid passing through space that has not been explored, or that is not reached by the sensor. When it is set to "false" the robot will just consider that if its sensor does not mark explicitly an obstacle then it is free space.
